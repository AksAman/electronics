=== 2's Complementer ===

One input, one output serial 2's complementer.

'''Problem: '''

Design a one input, one output serial 2's complementer. The circuit accepts a string of bits from the input and generates the 2's complement at the output. The circuit can be reset asynchronously to start and end the operation.

'''Required:'''

# Show the design process and the final logic circuit.
# Simulate your circuit using your preferred simulator. Attach screenshots and/or simulation file.

'''Usage:'''

To compile, use iVerilog for Windows. More information from [http://goo.gl/kXqTY here].

'''Compilation Command:'''

<code>iVerilog dff_async_reset.v compliment.v compliment_tb.v -o compliment_tb.vvp</code>

'''Simulation Command:'''

<code>vvp compliment_tb.vvp -vcd</code>

'''Show wave:'''

<code>GTKWave compliment_tb.dump</code>

'''Discussion:'''

The output is 0 for all 0 inputs until the first 1 occurs at which time, the output is 1.
Thereafter, the output is the complement of the input.

The state diagram has two states

<code>State 0 : Output = Input
State1 : Output = Complement of input</code>

{|
|  Previous State || Input || Next State || Output
|-
|   A || X || A || Y
|-
|   0 || 0 || 0 || 0
|-
|   0 || 1 || 1 || 1
|-
|   1 || 0 || 1 || 1
|-
|   1 || 1 || 1 || 0
|}

DA = A + x
y = A &amp;otimes; x
