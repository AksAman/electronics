This is a Full version of ISim.
Time resolution is 1 ps

Simulator is doing circuit initialization process.
Finished circuit initialization process.

But this time, both G1 and G0 are emitting 1
after an initial G0 of 1. Which basically means
head first, then both his head and lower body is
being detected by the sensor as he's entering
